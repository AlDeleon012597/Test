### Project Directory Structure

### Repository Procedures 
The Master branch represents the current production version of the app and is protected.
All code is pulled into the current Development branch. Branches should represent specific features and issues.  
Open a branch to work on new features or issues. If an issue does not exist for the feature then create the issue and then assign it to yourself. This will ensure issues can be attached to branches and be closed during pull requests.
